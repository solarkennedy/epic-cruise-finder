=== Epic Cruise Finder ===

This program scrapes web pages and finds epic mega cruises.

=== What Are Epic Cruises? ===

If you look at a particular cruise ship's tour of duty, you will notice that 
it mostly will hang around in a particular part of the world for a season or
so. For example a cruise ship might hang out in the carribean area for the 
the summer months. 

However, when it is time for the cruise ship to move to a new part of the world
for a rotation change, it will have a special one-way cruise to that new area. 

These special one-way cruises are usually cheap. Like cheaper than the rent 
you are paying now. Seriously.

An example:

Quebec City to Tampa, Florida @ $31/night

=== So What? ===

So thats cool. Too bad I'm not in a position to take that cruise, and then
somehow make it back. Or am I...

Maybe there is a particular series of indiviual cruises that when combined
create a huge epic mega cruise at a seriously low price. This program is 
designed to find this Epic Cruise.
